#1.)Linear Regression:
#(a)MSE: 0.0005
#(b)R²: 0.8789
#Conclusion: High accuracy and good fit for linear relationships. Likely a strong contender.
#2.Decision Tree:
#Expected: May overfit with high R² but lower generalization. Check MSE to confirm performance.
#Random Forest:
#Expected: Likely to outperform Decision Tree by reducing overfitting, with lower MSE and high R². Best for complex relationships.
#Action: Compare results after running all models:
#If Random Forest has the lowest MSE and highest R², it’s the best.
#Otherwise, stick with Linear Regression for simplicity and efficiency.
