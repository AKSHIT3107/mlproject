## Model Evaluation and Conclusion

### Models Evaluated:
1. **Linear Regression**
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 0.0005
   - **RÂ² Score:** 0.8789
   - **Conclusion:** Linear Regression performed well with high accuracy and a strong fit for linear relationships.

2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
   - **Expected Results:** Prone to overfitting. Suitable for capturing non-linear patterns, but less robust compared to Random Forest.

3. **Random Forest Regressor**
   - **Expected Results:** Likely the most robust model, effectively reducing overfitting and handling complex relationships.

### Final Recommendation:
Based on the evaluation metrics:
- **Linear Regression** is suitable for datasets with linear relationships and is computationally efficient.
- **Random Forest** is recommended if the data exhibits complex patterns or non-linear relationships.

For this project, **Linear Regression** was selected as the best-performing model due to its high accuracy.
